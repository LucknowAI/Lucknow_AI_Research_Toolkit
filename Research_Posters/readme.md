Examples of the poster and guidelines are given below


## Poster Specifications:
- **Size**: Posters should be no wider than 91 cm (36 in) and no taller than 122 cm (48 in), in vertical (portrait) orientation. A0 paper in portrait orientation fits these dimensions.

## Set-up and Preparation:
- **Arrival**: Arrive at least 20 minutes before the session starts, during the preceding break, to locate your poster space and mount it using the provided tape.
- **Poster locations**: These will be listed in a guide distributed to participants, and volunteers will be available to assist if needed.

## Poster Cleanup:
- **End of session**: Remove your poster immediately after the session ends to make space for the next set of posters.

## Designing Your Poster:
- **Attraction**: Your poster should clearly communicate the main idea and findings, even within a brief 1-minute glance.
- **Discussion aid**: Prepare a 2-5 minute talk summarizing the key problem and results. Expect questions for further details.
- **Font size**: Titles should be readable from 3-5 meters away, while the body text should be legible from 1-2 meters.
- **Layout**: Follow a traditional reading path (left to right, top to bottom) to enhance readability. Consider organizing content by columns or rows.

## Poster Structure:
- **Typical sections**: 
  - Motivation (problem and its significance, possibly illustrated with an example)
  - Approach and contributions
  - Experiments and results
  - Conclusion (optional: acknowledgements and references)
  - No abstract required.

## Networking Tips:
- **Engage with attendees**: Always exchange names and affiliations with people interested in your work. Networking is an essential part of the event.
- **Preparedness**: Bring at least one printed copy of your paper for reference.

## Practical Suggestions:
- **Stay hydrated**: Have water and snacks on hand, as you'll be talking a lot.
- **Poster material**: If possible, print your poster on fabric for easy transportation.
- **Feedback**: Print a draft of your poster on A4 paper and ask colleagues for feedback on clarity and potential typos.
